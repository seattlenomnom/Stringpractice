* Ok, a complicated situation: I can create the string that I want from the
* console. It involves getchar() and some extra code. It is very capable.
* But what are all those C string library functions for? I need to study
* those. I can move back to my original problem -- can't remember the name.
*
* Why won't the string printf()?
*
* I have not changed to the do while structure!.
*
* Rememeber that getchar() will put newline into string. You need to
* overwrite it with the \0.
*
* I need to study C library functions. What they do, where you use them,
* and how to use their return values to perform error checking.
